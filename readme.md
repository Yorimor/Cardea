### systemd/systemctl process status page written in Go

---

Used for monitoring systemd services/units, with a basic view on the current status.

Units that can be monitored are typically found/made in `/etc/systemd/system`

Check out `example_units.json`

When deploying, `index.html` and `units.json` need to be placed in the same folder as the built executable
